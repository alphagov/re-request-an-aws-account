      <p>There are a number of ways of accessing your AWS accounts, but GDS recommends users use AWS's cross account access pattern.</p>
      <p>To support this, GDS maintains a set of <a href="https://gds-way.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/manuals/working-with-aws-accounts.html#access-aws-accounts">centrally managed user identities in a base account called gds-users.</a></p>
      <p>Anyone within GDS or the Cabinet Office can request user access to AWS for one or more people.</p>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Remove an AWS user</h3>
      <p>
        You should ensure that users are removed from <em>gds-users</em> as part of your team's leavers process. It is not sufficient to remove the role or trust policy from your AWS account, you must also remove the user from gds-users by submitting the form below. Only request removal when the person leaves GDS/CO or they no longer need access to any AWS resources.
